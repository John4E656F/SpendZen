## 🤔 About The Project

In a world of one-click purchases and targeted ads, it's easy to lose track of our long-term financial goals. We often make impulse buys driven by **_wants_** rather than **_needs_**, creating a disconnect between our daily spending and our future aspirations.

**Spendzen** is here to bridge that gap. It's not just another budgeting app; it's your personal _decision-making coach_. By introducing a moment of mindful pause and guided reflection, Spendzen helps you understand the **why** behind your purchases. Our Socratic AI engages you in a simple conversation to determine if a purchase aligns with your values and goals, helping you build healthier financial habits from the ground up.

> Our core philosophy is built on **Awareness over Restriction**. We empower you with clarity, so every purchase becomes an intentional choice.

## ✨ Core Features

- 🤖 **Socratic AI Coach:** Engage in a thoughtful conversation with an AI designed to help you differentiate between a "want" and a "need," and even suggest better alternatives.
- 🎯 **Goal-Oriented Tracking:** Define what you're saving for (a vacation, a down payment, etc.) and see in real-time how skipping a purchase brings you closer to your dreams.
- 📊 **Mindful Savings Log:** A visual log of all the money you've saved by making intentional choices, providing powerful positive reinforcement.
- 🎁 **Smart Suggestions:** The AI can help you find better, cheaper, or more meaningful alternatives for purchases, including gifts.
- 🤔 **The "Purchase Pause":** Implement a "cooling-off" period for non-essential items, giving you time to reflect before you buy.
